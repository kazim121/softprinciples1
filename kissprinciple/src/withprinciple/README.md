Problem: Library Management System

In this example, we are implementing a simple library management system where users can borrow and return books.

Without applying the KISS principle:
- We overcomplicate the design by introducing unnecessary inheritance (e.g., `Book` is abstract and extends another class).
- We add complex methods for borrowing and returning books that aren't needed.
- The system becomes harder to maintain due to unnecessary abstractions and additional methods.

With the KISS principle:
- We keep the design simple, focusing on essential functionality: managing books and handling borrowing/returning books.
- We eliminate unnecessary abstractions and complex logic.
- The system is easy to understand, maintain, and extend in the future.

By following the KISS principle, we avoid overcomplicating the system and ensure that it remains clear and easy to work with.
